Find an event buddy
People who want to go to a concert or event happening nearby, but don’t have anyone to go with can use this platform to find and communicate with others who are also interested in the same events.
Potential APIS: Bandsintown, Eventful, Spotify
Potential Features:
User Profiles/Interests
Listing of upcoming events user might be interested in
User matching to assist in finding an event buddy
Messaging between users who might want to go to an event together
Automatic playlist creation of an artist’s setlist after the user goes to concert

There are a lot of people who want to go to a concert or musical event near them but do not have anybody to go with. Our idea is a platform for people to find events that are happening in their area based on their musical preferences, and to find people interested in the same events. APIs that we can use for this project are Bandsintown, and Eventful for accessing details about concerts that are happening nearby. We can also use Spotify’s API to get data about the music that a user listens to and use that data to personalize their experience. A user will be able to log in using their Facebook or Google accounts. Their profile will be built upon the data from their login account and Spotify data, and can be stored in our own database. Potential features include user matching for people looking to go to similar or same events, direct messaging, creating a spotify playlist based on an artists’ setlist after the user goes to the concert, and more. 



Calories monitor
People who want to lose/gain weight, but have no idea how much calories need to take in, or how much workout should do, can use this application to record and monitor whether they are on the right path to their goals.
Potential APIS: MyFitnessPal, Google map,
Potential Features:
User Profiles/Personal data
Record and Calculate user daily calories consumption
Making plan for user
Many people want to lose/gain weight, but don’t know how much work should be done, or how much food should take in. The app calculates the daily net calories consumption by recording what food the user takes in, which type of workout the user performs, and how much distance the user travels by foot.  We can use MyFitnessPal’ API to get data about the calories of certain foods and the calories consumption of the sports. By collecting the personal data of the user, i.e. ,height, weight, age, gender, the app can make the plan for the user to achieve their goals.
